# Mezzanine Configurator

The Mezzanine Configurator is an interactive web application built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js that enables users to design and visualize custom mezzanine structures in real-time. Users can adjust dimensions (length, width, height), select load capacities (250KG, 350KG, or 500KG per m²), and add accessories such as stairs, railings, and pallet gates. The application features a 3D viewer powered by React Three Fiber that provides an immersive visualization of the configured mezzanine, along with real-time pricing calculations and a quote request form for generating project estimates.

To set up the project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory, then run
`npm install`
to install all dependencies including React, TypeScript, Vite, Three.js, React Three Fiber, and Tailwind CSS. Once dependencies are installed, use
`npm run dev`
to start the development server, which will launch the application on a local development port with hot module replacement enabled. For production builds, run
`npm run build`
to compile and optimize the application, and
`npm run preview`
to preview the production build locally.
